# android_simple_app
Simple app that shows end to end dev of an app


The app is a working example of somthing that commonly comes up in interviews for Android developers.

The idea of this project is to show the following:

1. Knowledge of how to bind data from the network layer to the UI Layer
2. Knowledge of working with common UI libraries to handle image loading, data binding, etc.
3. Knowledge of building interfaces to access network clients
4. Knowledge of separation of code to modularize application
5. Knowledge of common networking libraries
6. Knowledge of local data storage and caching
7. Knowledge of threading and concurrent tasks
8. Knowledge of material design 
8. Knowledge of rxjava and rxandroid


This is just one possible to solution to building an app that fetches a list of objects, and creates
an user interface to display them. I used https://github.com/typicode/json-server#example this json server
to serve up fake data. Anyone using this repo to test should first run this server locally.

Also, this was made not to be overly complicated and designed to show about how much one can actually
accomplish in one interview sitting (maybe a bit more). This is why I didn't actually build out an MVP
framework for this app, use DI, etc.
